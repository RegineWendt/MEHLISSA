# MEHLISSA Next User Guide

**Guide status:** living document

**Covered software:** M0 through M2.6

**Last updated:** 27 August 2026

This guide is the main entry point for people who want to build, inspect, and
run MEHLISSA Next. It will grow with each milestone. Internal architecture
decisions and scientific derivations remain in the linked specialist
documents; this guide focuses on practical use and interpretation.

## 1. What you can do today

The current software can:

- validate versioned experiment manifests;
- create provenance, run-log, and checkpoint artifacts for a minimal run;
- validate arbitrary vascular graphs without recompiling;
- reproduce the canonical 95-segment dissertation graph from released legacy
  source data;
- run the deterministic M2.4 BloodVoyagerS distribution regression;
- transport identity-preserving particles through a vascular graph;
- schedule injection and extraction events;
- collect bounded trajectories, population snapshots, sample-site events, and
  passive gateway measurements;
- apply versioned rest, exercise, and posture profiles without rebuilding the
  executable.

The software does not yet contain the detailed lung, capillary, cellular, or
active Nano-IoT communication models. Those layers begin with M3.

## 2. Repository orientation

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apps/` | command-line application |
| `core/` | generic simulation clock, lifecycle, quantities, and random streams |
| `experiment/` | manifests, provenance, logs, and checkpoints |
| `models/body/` | validated vascular graphs, transport, state profiles, and body-level reports |
| `data/body-models/` | canonical executable vascular models |
| `data/body-states/` | state overlays for compatible body models |
| `data/schemas/` | versioned JSON Schemas |
| `data/reference-results/` | checked-in scientific Golden References |
| `examples/` | minimal manifests and synthetic models |
| `tests/` | software, invariant, schema, and regression tests |
| `docs/` | user, scientific, architecture, and development documentation |
| `mehlissa/`, `mehlissa2.0/` | historical implementations retained as references |

## 3. Prerequisites

On Windows, install:

- Visual Studio Community 2026;
- the **Desktop development with C++** workload;
- CMake 3.28 or newer;
- vcpkg, exposed through `VCPKG_ROOT`.

The recommended editor is Visual Studio Code with Microsoft's **C/C++** and
**CMake Tools** extensions. These extensions improve editing and project
control, but the Visual Studio C++ workload supplies the actual compiler.

Linux builds use a C++20 compiler, CMake, Ninja, and vcpkg. See the
[Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) for the supported presets.

## 4. Configure, build, and test on Windows

Open **Developer PowerShell for VS 2026**, change to the repository root, and
run:

```powershell
$cmake = Join-Path $env:VSINSTALLDIR 'Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe'
$ctest = Join-Path $env:VSINSTALLDIR 'Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\ctest.exe'

& $cmake --preset windows-msvc
& $cmake --build --preset windows-msvc-debug
& $ctest --preset windows-msvc-debug --output-on-failure
```

The debug CLI is then available at:

```text
build/windows-msvc/apps/Debug/mehlissa.exe
```

All paths in the following examples are relative to the repository root.

## 5. Command overview

Run the CLI without arguments to print its current syntax:

```powershell
build/windows-msvc/apps/Debug/mehlissa.exe
```

The non-zero exit is intentional because a command is required. Stable exit
categories are documented in [Errors, Logs, and Checkpoints](m1/ERRORS_LOGS_CHECKPOINTS.md).

### 5.1 Validate an experiment manifest

```powershell
build/windows-msvc/apps/Debug/mehlissa.exe validate `
  --experiment examples/experiments/minimal.json `
  --schema data/schemas/experiment/1.0.0.schema.json
```

Validation first checks the JSON Schema and then semantic constraints such as
duration, seed, model list, and output directory.

### 5.2 Run the minimal deterministic experiment

```powershell
build/windows-msvc/apps/Debug/mehlissa.exe run `
  --experiment examples/experiments/minimal.json `
  --schema data/schemas/experiment/1.0.0.schema.json `
  --checkpoint-schema data/schemas/checkpoint/1.0.0.schema.json
```

The configured output directory receives:

- `provenance.json` with software, input hash, seed, and timing information;
- `checkpoint-000000.json` with clock and random-stream state;
- `run.log.jsonl` with structured lifecycle events.

This command currently demonstrates the reproducible M1 runtime contract. Body
transport is connected to full experiment orchestration in M3.

### 5.3 Validate a vascular model

```powershell
build/windows-msvc/apps/Debug/mehlissa.exe validate-body `
  --model data/body-models/bvs95-dissertation-rest-v1.json `
  --schema data/schemas/vascular-graph/1.0.0.schema.json
```

Validation covers stable IDs, SI units, geometry, area, volume, velocity,
flow, transition probabilities, source references, strong connectivity, and
junction-flow conservation.

To prove that the loader is not hard-coded for BVS95, validate the synthetic
four-segment model with the same executable:

```powershell
build/windows-msvc/apps/Debug/mehlissa.exe validate-body `
  --model examples/body-models/synthetic-branching-circuit.json `
  --schema data/schemas/vascular-graph/1.0.0.schema.json
```

### 5.4 Recreate the canonical 95-segment model

```powershell
build/windows-msvc/apps/Debug/mehlissa.exe migrate-legacy-95 `
  --vasculature mehlissa2.0/data/95_vasculature.csv `
  --transitions mehlissa2.0/data/95_transitions.csv `
  --output build/bvs95-recreated.json `
  --schema data/schemas/vascular-graph/1.0.0.schema.json
```

The converter is deterministic. Tests require its result to match the
checked-in canonical graph byte for byte. It does not overwrite the historical
CSV files.

### 5.5 Run the M2.4 scientific regression

```powershell
build/windows-msvc/apps/Debug/mehlissa.exe reference-bvs `
  --model data/body-models/bvs95-dissertation-rest-v1.json `
  --output build/bvs95-reference-report.json `
  --schema data/schemas/vascular-graph/1.0.0.schema.json `
  --report-schema data/schemas/bvs-reference-report/1.0.0.schema.json
```

This run checks:

- minute-7 versus minute-120 distribution equilibrium;
- aorta versus popliteal injection;
- 6,359 versus 63,590 particles;
- exact population conservation;
- the 23 dissertation perfusion targets.

The expected checked-in result is
`data/reference-results/bvs95-dissertation-rest-m2.4.json`. Scientific meaning
and limitations are explained in the [M2.4 report](m2/BVS_REFERENCE_REGRESSION.md).

### 5.6 Apply a body-state profile

The same executable can derive a state-specific graph from a compatible base
model. No source change or rebuild is required.

```powershell
build/windows-msvc/apps/Debug/mehlissa.exe apply-body-state `
  --model data/body-models/bvs95-dissertation-rest-v1.json `
  --profile data/body-states/bvs95-supine-cycle-exercise-1.9x-v1.json `
  --output build/bvs95-exercise.json `
  --schema data/schemas/vascular-graph/1.0.0.schema.json `
  --profile-schema data/schemas/body-state-profile/1.0.0.schema.json
```

Available M2.6 profiles are:

| Profile | Cardiac-output effect | Interpretation |
|---|---:|---|
| `bvs95-rest-supine-v1.json` | ×1.0, 6.0 L/min | historical dissertation identity baseline |
| `bvs95-supine-cycle-exercise-1.9x-v1.json` | ×1.9, 11.4 L/min | global-flow exercise sensitivity |
| `bvs95-head-up-tilt-70deg-v1.json` | ×0.7833, 4.7 L/min | global-flow head-up-tilt sensitivity |

The profile is schema-validated and must name the exact compatible model and
version. Application then:

1. applies any topology-preserving transition overrides;
2. solves the complete stationary flow system;
3. anchors it to the requested cardiac-output multiplier;
4. recomputes mean velocity from flow and fixed cross-sectional area;
5. validates the resulting vascular graph again;
6. writes all profile sources and validity limits into the derived model.

The exercise and tilt files are sensitivity profiles, not clinically validated
physiological models. Read their `limitations` arrays and the
[M2.6 model note](m2/BODY_STATE_PROFILES.md) before interpreting results.

## 6. Transport observations and extraction

M2.5 transport observation is currently exposed as a typed C++ API. A
`CompartmentTransport` can be configured with:

- scheduled `InjectionEvent` and `ExtractionEvent` objects;
- passive `sample` and `gateway` measurement sites;
- trajectories selected as `none`, `all`, or deterministic `first_n`;
- hard record limits for trajectories and individual measurements;
- a population-snapshot interval and hard snapshot limit.

When a detail limit is reached, the report sets the corresponding truncation
flag. Aggregate measurement counts and the invariant
`active + extracted = injected` remain exact.

The output writer validates JSON against:

```text
data/schemas/transport-observation-report/1.0.0.schema.json
```

The full event-order and truncation contract is documented in
[Transport Output, Extraction, and Measurement Sites](m2/TRANSPORT_OBSERVATION.md).
A CLI/manifest connection for this typed configuration is planned as part of
M3 orchestration.

## 7. M3 developer preview: the first lung boundary

M3 has started with a typed C++ boundary rather than a scenario-specific body
shortcut. A `ModelComponent` exposes a stable model ID, named entity entry and
exit ports, and versioned entity transfers. The first implementation is
`LungCompartment`, a coarse pulmonary-circulation surrogate with a configured
fixed transit time.

The current contract verifies that:

- an incoming transfer names its source and target model and port;
- acceptance occurs at the declared synchronization time;
- an entity ID cannot exist twice inside the organ boundary;
- identity and entity type survive pulmonary transit;
- the outgoing transfer names the configured venous return route; and
- compatible time-step subdivisions produce the same transfer result.

This is currently a developer API and contract-test slice. The CLI cannot yet
compose a body and lung experiment, and the existing body transport does not
yet hand entities to the organ automatically. M3.2 adds that adapter and the
first complete body → lung → body test. Population and substance-flow exchange
follow as separate conservative contracts. See the [M3 working plan](m3/README.md)
and [lung model card](m3/LUNG_COMPARTMENT.md) before interpreting this model.

## 8. How to interpret model evidence

MEHLISSA distinguishes:

- **historical regression:** reproduces a previous implementation or paper;
- **calibration:** chooses parameters to match target values;
- **verification:** checks software and numerical invariants;
- **validation:** compares against independent evidence;
- **sensitivity scenario:** explores a transparent assumption without claiming
  complete physiology.

These labels are not interchangeable. In particular:

- the BVS95 geometry is schematic;
- its equivalent diameters are transport parameters, not measured anatomy;
- the M2.4 perfusion table is a calibration regression;
- the M2.6 exercise and posture profiles change global flow but do not yet
  model complete regional redistribution;
- none of the current outputs is patient-specific or suitable for clinical
  decision-making.

## 9. Troubleshooting

### CMake selects the wrong Visual Studio version

Use **Developer PowerShell for VS 2026** and the CMake executable installed
inside Visual Studio, as shown in section 4. A globally installed older CMake
may not recognize the `Visual Studio 18 2026` generator.

### vcpkg dependencies cannot be downloaded

Check that `VCPKG_ROOT` points to a valid vcpkg installation. If network access
is temporarily unavailable, use the dependency-free smoke preset described in
the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md). It checks the core but does not replace
the complete suite.

### A model or profile is rejected

Read the stable error identifier and message. Common causes are:

- using the wrong schema version;
- applying a profile to a different model ID or version;
- transition probabilities that do not sum to one;
- topology-changing overrides;
- flow, velocity, or geometry values that violate SI invariants;
- an unknown data-source reference.

### The full test suite takes longer than expected

The M2.4 regression simulates both 6,359 and 63,590 particles and recreates its
Golden Reference. A complete debug suite therefore takes roughly one to two
minutes on the current Windows reference system.

## 10. Where this guide goes next

The guide will be extended with:

- M3 experiment-level body/organ composition and the detailed pulmonary model;
- M4 capillary models and transport hand-offs;
- M5 cellular and molecular interaction models;
- M6 active gateway and Nano-IoT configuration;
- end-to-end fingerprinting scenarios;
- result analysis and visualization workflows.
